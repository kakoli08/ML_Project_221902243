# 🤖 ML_Project_221902243 – Interactive ML Lab  

An interactive **Streamlit-based Machine Learning Lab** project that demonstrates fundamental ML algorithms with clear visualizations.  
This project was developed as part of my **Machine Learning Lab course** to make algorithms easy to understand and test in real-time.  

---

## 🔹 Features  
This app covers **five core ML algorithms**:  

- 📌 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – classification on the Iris dataset with accuracy & confusion matrix  
- 📌 **Linear Regression** – predicting scores from hours studied (synthetic data)  
- 📌 **Logistic Regression** – binary classification (pass/fail) with ROC curve & decision curve  
- 📌 **K-Means Clustering** – clustering with Elbow method for selecting K  
- 📌 **Naive Bayes (Text Classification)** – spam vs. ham toy message filter
