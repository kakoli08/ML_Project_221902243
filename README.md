ðŸ¤– ML_Project_221902243 â€“ Interactive ML Lab

An interactive Streamlit-based Machine Learning Lab project that demonstrates fundamental ML algorithms with clear visualization.
This project was developed as part of my Machine Learning Lab course to make algorithms easy to understand and test in real-time.

Features

The app covers five core ML algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) â€“ classification on the Iris dataset with accuracy & confusion matrix

Linear Regression â€“ predicting scores from hours studied (synthetic data)

Logistic Regression â€“ binary classification (pass/fail) with ROC & decision curve

K-Means Clustering â€“ clustering with Elbow method for selecting K

Naive Bayes (Text Classification) â€“ spam vs. ham toy message filter
